# BigOAssignment

This project only took me about an 1 hour to get done.
I have done these types of algorithms before in other classes to loop through stuff so going into this class
the learing part is more really the talking or speach of the algoritms like the naming and types that they represent because before I didnt know they even had a name I just knew it wasn algorithm that loops through a list or an array and thats about it
